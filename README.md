# my-eth-hack-journey
in this repo i want to document my journey in learning ethical hacking. lets see were this will take me!

first, i want to start with hoppersroppers ctf course. I came across this in an reddit AmA from Aubrey Cottle so lets see if its as good as promised.

Concurrently, i want to take at look at River Loop Security's hardware hacking 101!

-> would be nice to finish both until march to be prepared for the CSCG 2022.
